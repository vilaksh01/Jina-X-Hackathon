```
## Set environment variables

Set env variables like ```JINA_DATA_PATH``` and ```MAX_DOCS```

| ``python app.py dryrun`` | Sanity check on the topology |

## Run as a Docker Container

To build the docker image
```bash
docker build -t jinaai/hub.app.anti_plagiarism:0.0.1 .
```

To mount local directory and run:
```bash
docker run -v "$(pwd)/j:/workspace" jinaai/hub.app.anti_plagiarism:0.0.1
``` 

To query
```bash
docker run -p 65481:65481 -e "JINA_PORT=65481" jinaai/hub.app.anti_plagiarism:0.0.1 search
